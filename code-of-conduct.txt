- we write our code in OOP
- we write our classes in separate files
- our classesnames should be in singular

example class:

class Player:
    player properties:
        name
        health
        inventory
        position
        current_planet
    
    player methods:
        move_up()
        move_down()
        move_left()
        move_right()
        visit_planet()
        collect_resource()
        get_status()

the class contains player properties and methods.


we also use git and don't use branches, but that is more a suggestion and not a rule.
Please adhere to the rules to insure code quality, maintainability, and scalability.
